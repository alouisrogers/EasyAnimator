From the last assignment, we adjusted the way that we sorted the commands for the text view so that
we use a TreeMap instead of the previous methods so that the list couldn't mutate. We also
combined parts of our code and clarified some other parts in small ways as we did so. In this
assignment we added a Controller and three Views. The controller processes the list of Strings
from the commandline in the main method and animates a view based on the commands. We had an
interface, IView that had the method show for animation, that was implemented by GUIView,
TextView, and SVGView. For the GUIView we made a separate VisualPanel that extended a JPanel from
the Java Swing in order to draw each frame of the animation. The VisualPanel used a GUIVisitor in
order to render each shape. We used a ShapeVisitor interface for this that was implemented by the
GUIVisitor and the ShapeRenderVisitor. For the TextView, we moved the previous text output
functionality from the model to this View and added a parameter for ticksPerSecond to adjust the
time reference in the output. For the SVGView we used visitors for the Commands and the Shapes to
render the proper SVG format for each.
